# R's Auto Accompaniment for Mainstage 3

Auto Accompaniment implementation for keys for Mainstage

## Into

Script designed to create patches to play cover versions of songs or music compositions.

Initially it assumes:
- all instruments managed by this script are placed in layers with exact start and end
- Play should be on (started)
- Key press starts songs: internal 'timer'. The start of beat's intervals is calculated from this moment.
